I have truncated specific javascript files to protect propitiatory rights.

This script can be viewed upon request by contacting myself.

This is for demonstration purposes only to show my skills.

Concepts
===
1) Picks a random number
2) Compares number to serve up end results of behind layer &amp; end result pushed URL
3) Can be adapted to have a javascript alert
4) Top layer scratches off based on reveal radius
5) Push URL happens after percent revealed and also based on timer

The fully complied script will:

Get IP / MAC address and compare to database
  a) If within database, serve lose
  b) If not within database, check repository for available prizes
  c) If no prizes available, serve lose
  d) If prizes available, random generate number to determine if will be winner
  e) If winning number picked, find next available date and time within database that is already predetermined 
  f) If now's date/time is prior to next available predetermined available prize, then serve lose
  g) If now's date/time is equal to or greater than next available prize then serve win.
  h) Will post to an encripted form with IP / MAC address and contact information to post to database.
